// Introduction to Lambda

/** Passing behaviour as argument 
 * 
 * method({code}, 10, "Ravi")
 * 
 * */

/*
 * Lambda is nothing but a way to pass custom code to a function to execute.
 * This was possible earlier only with the Anonymous class which was clumsy,
 * lambda reduced a lot of boilerplate code around that and makes it easy to
 * write functional code in Java.
 */
 
// Example 

/*
 * String name ="Jaya";
 *  System.out.println(name.toUpperCase()); */ // is this is a lambda expression


/**
 * No , ye lambda hota agar toUpperCase ki jagah (toUpperCase ka implementation likha hota)
 */
