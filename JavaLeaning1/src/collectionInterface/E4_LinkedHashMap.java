/*	LinkedHashMap is  used to store
	the key-value pairs like HashMap but it guarantees the order of insertion
	
	It is the same as HashMap with an additional feature that it maintains insertion order.
	For example, when we run the code with a HashMap, we get a different order of elements.
	
	A LinkedHashMap contains values based on the key. 
	It implements the Map interface and extends the HashMap class.
	
	It contains only unique elements.
	
	It may have one null key and multiple null values.
	
	
	A LinkedHashMap cannot contain duplicate keys. LinkedHashMap can have null values and the null key. 
	Unlike HashMap, the iteration order of the elements in a LinkedHashMap is predictable.
