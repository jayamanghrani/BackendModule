//Especially beginners get confused between Inheritance and Polymorphism. 

// Having multiple form / ngro ka dokha

// A ref used to call multiple 

// same syntax , diffrent o/p  in polymo

//Polymorphism is a simple concept where one variable can denote multiple objects

//polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. 

//If Inheritance provides "code re-usability" then Polymorphism provides the "flexibility" to your code


/*
 * How is polymorphism acheived? to acheive polymorphism in java ,
 *  we have 2 option:
 *   a) Method Overloading - same class, same name, diff argu
 *   
 *    b) Method overridiing - diff class, same signature
 * 
 */


//Benefits of polymorphism
/*
 * Simplicity Extensibility
 */



//Some differnces between both- 
/*
1) Inheritance creates a parent-child relationship between two objects,
while, Polymorphism takes advantage of that relationship to execute different codes for the same operation 
depending upon which object is performing it.

2) Inheritance provides code reusability, while Polymorphism provides flexibility and dynamic behavior.

4) Inheritance is supported using extends and implements keyword in Java, 
Polymorphism is supported using Overloading(Compile time binding) and Overriding(Run time binding) Concepts.

As I said, Inheritance is about the ability to inherit common properties and 
then add specific properties depending upon need.
It establishes the parent-child relationship which is key for Polymorphism.
