// Abstraction means hiding implementation details , buisness logic

// doesn't hide data ,hide implementation details
/*
 * we define a method and when caller call our method it gets the return value
 * not the implementation details . This is only Abstraction
 * 
 * 
 * Ex; 1 se n no. tak ka sum ka ek method bnate h 
 * 
 * public static int sum(int n)
 * {  
 * 		we can write logic using loop/Math formula/ Recursion
 * 
 * }
 * 
 * 
 * When caller will call our method , it will do like sum(5) = o/p 15,  caller don't know which logic we have written for sum .
 * 
 * This is Abstraction
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Agar apne code me abstraction krna h to implementation/logic   method ke andar dal dena , main ke andar mat likhna.
 * main se usko call krna
 *

 *  daily abstraction - ATM machine

//Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that "shows" only essential attributes and "hides" unnecessary information.

// Java says don't write duplicate code, instead use Abstraction to abstract common things in one place.

//Abstraction in Java is achieved by using the interface and abstract class in Java



//when do you use abstraction? ( most important in my view )

/*Use abstraction if you know something needs to be in class but the implementation of that varies. */
