//What is OOPS?

/*
 * two types of programming lang are there- 
 * 1. Object oriented prog lang ---- focus on data 
 * 2. procedure oriented prog lang----focus on functions
 * 
 */

//Java is Object oriented language , 

/*Important concept in OOPS-

1.Object 

2.Class

3.Abstraction (abstract class and interface)

4.Encapsulation

5.Polymorphism

6.Inheritance

7.Composition

//Interview Questions

//1. Is Java a Pure Object Oriented Programming Language?
		
/*There are seven qualities to be satisfied for a programming language to be pure Object Oriented. They are:	
		
	1. Encapsulation/Data Hiding

	2. Inheritance

	3. Polymorphism

	4. Abstraction

	5. All predefined types are objects

	6. All operations are performed by sending messages to objects

	7. All user-defined types are objects.	*/
		
		//Java is not 100% object-oriented language. 

	/*Java does satisfy most of them.
		
	in a pure object-oriented language everything is an object 
	and there are many things in Java that are not objects like primitive data types 
	like boolean, char, short, int, long, float, double, different kinds of arithmetic, logical and bitwise operator like +, -. *, /, &&, || etc.*/
		

	/*
		You can make your program pure object-oriented by using Autoboxing,
		but Java compiler supports primitive data types, 
		so Java cannot be Pure object-oriented unless it makes everything in terms of objects.*/
